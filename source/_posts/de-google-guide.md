I have decided to take control of my own data.
As a person who has Google deeply embedded into my life, this is gonna be hard.

I will attempt to find suitable replacements for various Google Services and Apps.

- Gmail
- Drive
- Search
- Chrome
- Contacts
- Photos
- Password Manager
- Authenticator
- Youtube?
- Music?
- Android? – Lineage without Google Apps? Still not sure about this one.

In the next few weeks and/or months, I will be posting guides/reviews for each service/app replacements and why I choose them, as well as a summary at the end of how much all of this will cost.

For some services, I still have no idea of a replacement that is good enough, they are indicated with a question mark. Feel free to recommend stuff in the comments 🙂

> Edit: as of late 2017 there is a lot more useful information about this online then there was when I started writing this and recently I hardly find the time to focus properly on this project, so I am putting this series of guides on an indefinite pause. Sorry 😭
