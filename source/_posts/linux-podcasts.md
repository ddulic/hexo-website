Over the last 2-3 years, I have been listening to various podcasts, most, if not all Linux related… I have probably tried every single one that even mentions Linux, but in the end stopped listening to most, only a few remain…

And here is the list of Linux podcasts I listen to (in no specific order, as of May 2017):

- [Linux Unplugged](http://www.jupiterbroadcasting.com/show/linuxun/)
- [Ubuntu Podcast](http://ubuntupodcast.org)
- [Bad Voltage](http://www.badvoltage.org)
- [Late Night Linux](https://latenightlinux.com)
- [Hacked Podcast](http://www.hackedpodcast.com)
 

On the not Linux related side I also listen to The [#AskGaryVee Show](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/the-askgaryvee-show/id928159684?mt=2) and a Serbian one called [Male Pobede](http://malepobede.rs).

As for my player. I use [Pocket Casts](http://www.shiftyjelly.com/android/pocketcasts) on both my phone and my desktop (web player with a [dark stylish theme](https://userstyles.org/styles/121199/pocket-casts-night-mode-complete))

That is all.
